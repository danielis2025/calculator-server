# Creating a basic Python MCP Server
This is a basic MCP server where I set up the development environment for Python.
## How to use the server
- To run the server `mcp run server.py`.

I used **inspector** start up the server and lets you interact with it so you can test that it works.
- To run the inspector `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector mcp run server.py`
- The test would launch the server in a browser
### Steps
1. Click **Connect**. This should connect to the server.
2. Select **Tools** and **listTools**, you should see **Add** show up, select **Add** and fill in the parameter values.

## How to use the Client
- Run the Client using `python client.py`
